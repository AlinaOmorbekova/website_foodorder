# website_foodorder
This website is made to help people with ordering food and Admin panel for managing orders
Clients can see here a website with categories of foods like Pizza, Pasta, or Tea. Cliking those categories there will be dishes. Client can order food by filling the blank. 
And there is also an Adimn panel. Admin can add admins, change passwords for them, add categories with images, update them, add food with images, update, delete them, manage orders. I used PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MYSQL database to do this project
